# WGU_BubbleChat

Combined graph theory with a console that users can type and submit messages. These chat messages will generate a graph where each node is a word, and each edge is the space between words. The size of the node is determined by occurrences or frequency of input. Therefore, words with more frequency create a larger node and words with less frequency will have a smaller node. Users can click on nodes to browse the chat messages that contain that word.
